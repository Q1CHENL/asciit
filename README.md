# asciit

A more compact and intuitive ASCII table in your terminal: an alternative to `man 7 ascii` and `ascii`. Colored numbers and letters are much more easier to find. The table style is inspired by [hexyl](https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl)

### Note

- size of vertical table: 49x30
- size of horizontal table: 97x20

You may need to adjust your terminal window size to view the entire vertical table or to ensure correct display of the horizontal one.
